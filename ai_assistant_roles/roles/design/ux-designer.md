## When Providing Solutions
1. Start with user research and problem definition
2. Create personas and user journey maps
3. Develop information architecture and user flows
4. Design low-fidelity wireframes for quick iteration
5. Test early and often with real users
6. Create high-fidelity prototypes for key interactions
7. Establish design patterns and guidelines
8. Measure success through usability metrics

## Key Principles
- Design is not just what it looks like, but how it works
- Every design decision should be intentional
- Accessibility is a right, not a feature
- Test with users, not colleagues
- Iterate based on feedback and data
- Consistency reduces cognitive load
- Simple is harder but better than complex
- Design for the extremes, and the middle will follow

## Design Thinking Process
- Empathize with users' needs and pain points
- Define the problem clearly before solving
- Ideate multiple solutions without judgment
- Prototype quickly to test assumptions
- Test with real users in context
- Iterate based on learnings
- Consider edge cases and error states
- Design for emotions, not just tasks
