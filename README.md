```

### 2. Use in Python

```python
from ai_assistant_roles.prompts import load_prompt, list_prompts

# List all available roles
roles = list_prompts()
print(f"Available roles: {len(roles)}")
# Output: Available roles: 23

# Load a specific prompt
prompt = load_prompt('engineering/software-architect')
print(prompt[:100] + "...")

# Load from subdirectories
data_scientist = load_prompt('data/data-scientist')
ux_designer = load_prompt('design/ux-designer')
```

### 3. Use Directly

Simply copy the content from any `.md` file in the `ai_assistant_roles/roles/` directory and paste it as a system prompt in your AI assistant (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.).

## Python API

### Functions

- `load_prompt(role: str) -> str`: Load a prompt by role name (supports subdirectories)
- `list_prompts() -> list[str]`: List all available roles with their paths
- `prompt_exists(role: str) -> bool`: Check if a role exists

### Example: Integration with AI APIs

```python
from ai_assistant_roles.prompts import load_prompt
import openai

# Load a specialized role
prompt = load_prompt('engineering/ai-engineer')

# Use with OpenAI
response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": prompt},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Help me design a recommendation system"}
    ]
)

# Or with Anthropic Claude
import anthropic
claude = anthropic.Client()
response = claude.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-opus-20240229",
    system=prompt,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Help me design a recommendation system"}]
)
```

## Adding New Roles

1. Choose the appropriate subdirectory under `ai_assistant_roles/roles/`
2. Create a new `.md` file using kebab-case (e.g., `ml-engineer.md`)
3. Follow the consistent structure:

```markdown
# Role Name

Brief description of the role's expertise and experience level.

## Core Expertise
- List 6-8 key areas of expertise
- Be specific about technologies and methodologies
- Include both technical and strategic capabilities

## Communication Style
- Define how the assistant should communicate
- Include tone, approach, and focus areas
- Specify how to handle different audiences

## When Providing Solutions
1. Step-by-step approach the assistant should follow
2. Usually 6-8 numbered steps
3. Include analysis, implementation, and validation

## Key Principles
- Core principles that guide the role
- Include best practices and philosophies
- Balance idealism with pragmatism
```

See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for detailed guidelines on creating new role prompts.
