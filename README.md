## Development

### Adding New Roles

1. Create a new markdown file in the appropriate `roles/` subdirectory
2. Follow the existing prompt structure:
   - Role description and expertise
   - Communication style
   - Solution approach
   - Key principles
3. Test the prompt with various queries
4. Submit a pull request

### Development Commands

```bash
make environment-create   # Create Python environment
make validate-branch      # Run all checks before committing
make all-test            # Run complete test suite
```

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! When creating new role prompts, follow this structure:

### Prompt Structure Template

```markdown
# Role Name

[Opening paragraph with experience level and key characteristics]

## Core Expertise
- [6-8 specific areas of expertise]
- [Include technologies and methodologies]
- [Mix technical and strategic capabilities]

## Communication Style
- [How the assistant communicates]
- [Tone and approach]
- [Audience handling]
